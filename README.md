# Tutorial on Quantum ESPRESSO
QE tutorial for Skoltech courses on Computational Methods in Atomistic Simulations (CMAS) and Thermodynamics of Materials (TM)

This practical course aims to provide practical knowledge on how to start modelling real systems, their electronic properties, stability and mechanical properties using electron density functional theory, which is implemented in the `Quantum ESPRESSO` software package

More details and information on the courses can be found [here](https://sites.skoltech.ru/iocd/courses/)
